        Thanks for your interest in this project! üöÄ

        Please follow these instructions, fill every question, and do every step. üôè

        I'm asking this because answering questions and solving problems in GitHub is what consumes most of the time.

        I end up not being able to add new features, fix bugs, review pull requests, etc. as fast as I wish because I have to spend too much time handling questions.

        All that, on top of all the incredible help provided by a bunch of community members, that give a lot of their time to come here and help others.

        That's a lot of work, but if more users came to help others like them just a little bit more, it would be much less effort for them (and you and me üòÖ).

        By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier to help you.

        And there's a high chance that you will find the solution along the way and you won't even have to submit it and wait for an answer. üòé

        As there are too many questions, I'll have to discard and close the incomplete ones. That will allow me (and others) to focus on helping people like you that follow the whole process and help us help you. ü§ì

        If I (or someone) can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance I (or someone) will be able to help you.
